# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub pages whenever changes are made to the source branch.
Create a new branch with your changes and submit a PR against `source`. Once merged, your changes will be visible at https://podium-lib.io/
