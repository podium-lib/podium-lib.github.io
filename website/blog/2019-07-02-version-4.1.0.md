Version 4.1.0 of `@podium/layout` and `@podium/podlet` are now available.

### Assets

This release contain some minor changes to the `.js()` and `.css()` methods in
both `@podium/layout` and `@podium/podlet` paves ground for work we are doing to
improve asset handling and bundling when building microfrontends with Podium.

These changes are:

Currently the `.js()` and `.css()` methods return theirs target value when
called. This is now deprecated and these methods will cease to return a value in
the  near future.

If you are doing something like this:

```js
app.get(podlet.js({ value: '/assets.js' }), (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).sendFile('./src/js/main.js', err => {});
});
```

You should rewrite it to the following:

```js
app.get('/assets.js', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).sendFile('./src/js/main.js', err => {});
});

podlet.js({ value: '/assets.js' });
```

In addition to this `.js()` and `.css()` can now take an array of options
objects so its possible to set multiple assets in one go.

```js
app.use('/assets', express.static('./src/js'));

podlet.js([
    { value: '/assets/main.js' },
    { value: '/assets/extra.js' },
]);
```

We will write more about our work on asset handling and bundling when we have
some more concrete code to show.

### Proxy

This release does also contains a small fix to the proxy preventing it from
resolving a proxy request as successful after a failed proxy request has
occurred.

This mostly affected metrics causing failed proxy requests to also be counted
as successfull requests.
